# TODO

Tasks for the current phase. Check off as completed. At the start of each session, scan this together with `PROJECT_STATE.md`.

Durable source of truth for tasks. Claude's in-session `TaskCreate` may be used to break down an active item into sub-steps during implementation — but the checkboxes here are what persist.

## Phase 1 — Data Pillar MVP (COMPLETE)

All six sections shipped (§1 spec, §2 loaders + first-save dialog, §3 collector SKILL with messy-data refactor + Bug A/B/C/D fixes + netlist Spectre fix, §4 ingester, §5 full `pvt` CLI surface, §6 acceptance gates pinned as regression tests). Final tally: 254 / 254 Python tests green, 256 / 1 / 0 SKILL Tier-1 (1 baseline FAIL is the unchanged Maestro-open no-session test). Last commits: `41675e9` (dialog) through `b0c13da` (Phase 2 sharpening).

**Deferred from Phase 1 (do NOT block Phase 2):**
- §2.2 dialog Tier-2 manual UI verification — 5 scenarios documented at `skill/tests/tier2/scenarios.md`, sandbox at `/home/yusheng/cadence_work/dialog_sandbox/`. Pick up alongside any future UI-affecting change.
- §3 walker mock-rdb harness — DECISIONS #23; awaits real gappy-pid sim or budget for the `maeReadResDB` refactor.
- §3 screenshot v1.1 — S3_DESIGN §3.5; current one-shot warn + return nil suffices until a use case shows up.
- §3 messy-data Tier-2 against real failing-sim histories — **DONE 2026-05-12 via user-pre-staged histories**:
  - `simkit_simerr` (all sim err) — pass-2 produces 7 `failed`-status `__sim_status__` sentinels, one per active sub-corner. Clean.
  - `simkit_Rtime_err` (one corner's Rtime_clkout eval err) — pre-fix the row was silently dropped; **DECISIONS #35 introduced per-output `eval_err` sentinel** as the fix. Post-fix: 42 rows = 41 ok + 1 eval_err for `(TT_2p5G, Rtime_clkout)`. Both histories serve as standing Tier-2 references for the messy-data paths.

## Phase 2 — PVT-Union Builder

**Goal:** end-to-end loop from "describe one semantic PVT in a sidecar" → "tool emits the exploded Maestro corner table" → "round-trip is bit-identical."

Driven by the VCO LO 2026-05-11 motivating case (21 columns × 3 points = 63 corners that morally describe one PVT). Spec frozen at `docs/phase2_pvt_union_spec.md` (DECISIONS #29-31). Acceptance gates are §6 (Gates U1-U4).

### §1. Specification (no code yet — pure documentation)

- [x] `docs/phase2_pvt_union_spec.md` — pain, data model (vars + models axes), sidecar format, round-trip surface, CLI preview, acceptance gates, versioning, open decisions (8.1-8.6).
- [x] `config/pvt_union_example.union.json` — worked example matching the live `simkit_verify` corner-table (2 rows → 7 sub-corners).
- [x] `docs/schema.md` §1 additive update — `unionsDir` field added (no version bump, additive per unknown-key policy).

### §2. Python loader + validator

- [ ] `python/simkit/union.py` — JSON → typed union object; validate every §3.2 / §3.3 invariant.
- [ ] `python/simkit/union.py:explode()` — return sub-corner list per §3.4 (alphabetic key + lex-sorted values).
- [ ] `tests/test_union.py` — every load-error invariant; the simkit_verify example must explode to the exact 7-row table from spec §9; length-1 array round-trips without collapse.
- [ ] **Verification gate (per PM-mode rule):** `pytest tests/test_union.py` 100% green; `python -m simkit.union explode config/pvt_union_example.union.json` prints the spec §9 table verbatim.

**Open decisions blocking §2 start:** 8.1 (multiple unions per bench), 8.2 (unionsDir default), 8.4 (axlSetParameter in v1?), 8.6 (explode order on VCO LO). Pick defaults from spec §8 unless a domain reason surfaces.

### §3. SKILL bridge (pull + push)

- [x] `skill/pvtCorners.il` — `pvtCornersPull(?sess ?outPath ?unionName)` per spec §4.3. Vars via `axlGetVars`/`axlGetVar`/`axlGetVarValue`; models via `axlGetModels`/`axlGetModel`/`axlGetModel{File,Section,Block,Test}`. Sidecar JSON via Phase 1 `pvtJson` emitter. **VERIFIED via Tier-1 + Tier-2 live probe 2026-05-12; see DECISIONS #32 #33.**
- [x] `pvtCornersPush(?sess ?unionJsonPath ?dryRun)` — vars via `axlPutVar`; models via `axlPutModel` + `axlSetModel{Section,Block,Test}`. **VERIFIED 2026-05-12 against fnxSession0** (3 corners incl. vars+models sweeps): pull → push → pull round-trip is byte-identical modulo per-call `name` field. Tier-1: 256 → 300 / 0 (1 baseline FAIL flipped to PASS after Cadence restart; +13 push-side helper cases).
- [x] `skill/tests/testPvtCorners.il` — Tier-1 cases for pure helpers (30 cases registered; suite 256 → 286 / 1 / 0).
- [x] **§3.V Verification gate** — CLEARED 2026-05-12 after user reloaded sbStart.il. SKILL Tier-1 256 → 286 / 1 / 0 (1 baseline FAIL is Maestro-open no-session test, unchanged). Tier-2 live pull from `fnxSession0` reproduces spec §9 7-sub-corner table; Python `load_union` + `explode` round-trip is byte-clean. Four SKILL bugs caught during verification (1 arg-order, 4 operator-shorthand) and fixed; DECISIONS #32 records the named-function-vs-operator-shorthand rule, #33 records the verification.

### §4. (no separate §4 — Phase 2 has no analogue of Phase 1's ingester since the data is config, not run output)

### §5. `pvt corners` CLI

- [ ] `pvt corners build <union>.union.json [--out <path>]` — validate + emit Maestro corners-CSV. **Blocked on Open Decision 8.3** (CSV format); awaits real Maestro corners-CSV export sample.
- [x] `pvt corners explode <union>.union.json [--json]` — print sub-corner table.
- [x] `pvt corners list [--project P]` — enumerate unions in `<unionsDir>/`.
- [x] `pvt corners diff <a> <b>` — row-by-row axis-by-axis comparison.
- [x] `pvt corners push <union>.union.json [--project P] [--session S] [--dry-run]` — skillbridge → `pvtCornersPush`.
- [x] `pvt corners pull <output>.union.json [--project P] [--session S] [--union-name N]` — skillbridge → `pvtCornersPull`.
- [x] **Verification gate (per PM-mode rule):** pytest covers each subcommand (24 in `test_corners_cli.py`; 18 in `test_skill_bridge.py` for the wrapper layer). Live runtime-verified 2026-05-13 against `fnxSession0`: pull → push → pull → diff is 3/3 identical, dry-run does not perturb live state (`/tmp/cli_live_verify.sh`).

### §6. End-to-end acceptance gates

- [x] **Gate U1** — Round-trip fidelity on `fnxSession0` (live Maestro). Manually verified 2026-05-12 via `/tmp/probe_push.py` and offline-pinned 2026-05-13 (commit `8ae37bf`) via captured baseline → edited → post_edit_pull triple in `tests/fixtures/unions/u1_*` + 6-case `TestGateU1RoundTrip`. The edit-persists-and-pulls-back invariant: TT.temperature 55→85 push survives and re-pulls byte-identical; non-TT rows unaffected; baseline pushed back restores `fnxSession0` to its original 3-row state.
- [x] **Gate U2** — VCO LO acceptance. 2026-05-13: user didn't have VCO LO loaded; I synthesised the 21-row × 3-pt shape from the PHASE_PLAN.md / DECISIONS #29 description and pushed it into the live `fnxSession0`. Session went 3 → 24 rows; all 21 pushed rows pull back byte-identical (vars + models). Offline pinned at `tests/fixtures/unions/vco_lo_21x3.union.json` with 5 pytest cases in `TestGateU2VCOLoAcceptance` (load, row-count, ind-temp × process matrix, temperature-sweep shape, explode → 63 sub-corners, section-per-process). Open Decision 8.6: per-row sweep is only 1 axis × 3 values, so this case doesn't stress alphabetic-key explode order — that's still pending a multi-axis-per-row real case.
- [x] **Gate U3** — Explode arithmetic on a synthetic 2 × 3 × 5 = 30 union (`tests/test_acceptance_phase2.py::TestGateU3ExplodeArithmetic`, 6 tests).
- [ ] **Gate U4** — Sidecar → CSV → Sidecar bit-identical (modulo §4.2). Blocked on `pvt corners build` CLI subcommand (Open Decision 8.3 — CSV format).

### §7. Maintenance (do alongside, not at the end)

- [ ] Update `PROJECT_STATE.md` after each substantial chunk
- [ ] Append new decisions to `DECISIONS.md` as they happen
- [ ] Park any non-Phase-2 ideas into `PHASE_PLAN.md`
- [ ] Keep README usage section current
